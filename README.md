My second interaction with react. This is a simple program that asks users to input a password before being able to access some contact information.

Mini project from codecademy where I was provided a list of tasks to complete in order for the project to be finished. I had mini hints if I wasn't sure on a step but if I really got stuck somewhere, I was forced to do my own research to try and figure out the issue as I Was not provided any other hints or help.

This was my second interaction with react, gaining experience through making projects.

*NOTE*
Only the password 'swordfish' will authorize the user to login.
